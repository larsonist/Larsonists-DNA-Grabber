# Larsonist's DNA Grabber

Nice looking DNA Grabber for CH347 and RS232 cards, created by larsonist1 on Discord. Literally nothing special about it except that.

## Installation

You need Python 3 and pyinstaller. If you choose to compile it yourself, CD to the folder and run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller LarsonistDNAGrabber.spec
```

If you don't wanna compile it yourself, you can download the .exe in the releases tab on the right side.
